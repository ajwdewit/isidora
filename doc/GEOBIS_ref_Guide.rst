GEOBIS crop model service
=========================

The GEOBIS crop model service has been developed as part of the Geodata Based Information Services for smallholder farmers in Bangladesh (GEOBIS, which is funded by G4AW).

GEOBIS uses spatial and other geodata for providing effective, time- and location- and crop stage specific advisory services to smallholder farmers in Bangladesh. It is aimed at improving agricultural productivity and farmer income, upgrading agricultural zoning and at improving the management of weather related emergencies.

GEOBIS will provide farmers with weather related information, advice on the usage of seeds, land preparation, sowing, transplanting, irrigation, fertilizers and agrochemicals, and advice on preventive and remedial measures for controlling pest and diseases. 

Farmers will be informed through mobile phones, call centre, a website, app-based services as well as personal advice via extension officers and Lal Teerâ€™s field staff. 

The GEOBIS crop model (web) service provides crop growth data (BBCH) for a number of crops that are grown in Bangladesh:

- Rabi: 16 October to 15 March
- Kharif-1: 16 March to 15 July
- Kharif-2: 16 July to 15 October

The GEOBIS crop model service is based on PCSE (the Python Crop Simulation Environment) and delivers a JSON string containing the predicted crop growth plus alerts for crop treatments and possible weather induced stress.

A request (consisting of a crop ID, a location and a sowing date): e.g. http://27.147.142.61/geobis/request.py?cropid=10&lat=25.1233&lon=89.21333&sowday=20171230

results in the following JSON output::

	{"type":"cached",
