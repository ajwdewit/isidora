System for generating near-real time phenology driven crop and weather advisories

This system was originally developed in the [GeoBIS](https://g4aw.spaceoffice.nl/en/g4aw-projects/g4aw-projects/1/geobis.html) project. The original code has many dependencies on external databases and needs to be restructured on order to become a stand-alone application. The code and documentation currently resides on the develop branch of GeoBIS and a release will be done on main when this restructuring has been completed.
